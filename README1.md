Download the git software from http://git-scm.com/downloads as needed. Click on it and press next until it is finished downloading, make sure to select gitbash when prompted.  When it is done downloading, start a new android studio project by clicking on new project, it can be named anything. Once you are in the android studio build area, click on "file" then "new" and then "project from version control". Then press "github" enter https://github.com/Bhumik29/FBLADress.git as the the "Git Repository URL" then choose a location on your computer to save the new project and name the project whatever you would like. Then press clone. If you are asked for your github login, use kapika29@gmail.com as your username and bhumik2912 as your password. When the project opens in android studio, after it has loaded there will be two alerts, one will be an error and the other will say "frameworks detected". Click on configure when it says "frameworks detected, Android framework is detected in this project", then press "ok".  After the project has loaded, the error will be gone and you will be able to see the code. To view the entire code, look on the top left where is has the project name, underneath that it will say "Android", click on that and change it to "project". Then close the project and reopen the project. Then, you can scroll down to "INSTRUCTIONS FOR EMULATING" in this file to see how to emulate the app. 

IF YOU HAVE THE FLASHDRIVE FOLLOW THESE DIRECTIONS
Open Android Studio (Eclipse's official IDE) in order to view the code, it can only be viewed through Androd Studio. 
The code can be seen on Eclipse but, there will be some errors as Eclipse lacks some features of Android Studio. 
In Android Studio, click on import new project and from the flashdrive click on "click on me but do not import" and then click on "import this one" and begin importing the project.

The project will open up in Android Studio and you will be able to view all the code. 


Thank you and enjoy!


INSTRUCTIONS FOR EMULATING
-go to https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bhumikaa.bhumika29.fbladress
-You can emulate the app through the emulator on android studio/eclipse but you will not be able to try out the camera option because there is no sdk on the android studio/eclipse emulator. To use this option, launch any emulator and then press "run" and choose the emulator that you launched for viewing the app.
-To view the app through an android phone, connect the phone to the computer with the project open in android studio through a usb. Then go to the phone's settings and click on "about phone" and tap "build number" 6 or 7 times until it says "you are now a developer" and then return back to the settings of your phone to find "developer options", click on that and check "usb debugging". Then, go back to the project on your computer and click on run, then choose the android phone as the device through run it on. Then, the app will be able to be viewed from the phone. You can only post pictures through the "front camera" mode because otherwise the file is too large.
